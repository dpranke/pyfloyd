# Rejected ideas

These are ideas that I've had at one point or another for possible
changes or enhancements that I've ended up rejecting.

* Add `\1` for 'text matching $1.
  For now, you can do this easily enough with `={$1}`. I don't know
  that it'll come up often enough that we really need to improve it further.

* Add `.` as a synonym for `any`, `$` as a synonym for `end`.
  For now, I don't think this is enough of an improvement to complicate
  the semantics of punctuation symbols. It's probably clear enough what
  `any` and `end` mean.
